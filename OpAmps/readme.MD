# OpAmps

The file "Op-amp Graph Generator.xlsx" in this directory is an Excel spreadsheet that models various configurations of op-amps, including:
* Comparator
* Buffer
* Attenuator
* Unity-Gain Low-pass Filter (LPF)*
* Unity-Gain High-pass Filter (HPF)*
* Unity-Gain Band-pass Filter (BPF)*
* Inverting Amplifier/Invertor
* Inverting Aplifier + LPF*
* Inverting Aplifier + HPF*
* Inverting Amplifier + Bias
* Inverting Amplifier + Bias of V+/2 (Probe Referenced to V+/2)
* Inverting Amplifier + Bias + LPF
* Inverting Amplifier + Bias + HPF (AC Amplifier)*
* Non-Inverting Amplifier
* Non-Inverting Amplifier for Measuring Solution Conductivity (NonInv CMC)
* Non-Inverting Amplifier for Measuring Thermocouple Voltage (NonInv Thermocouple)
* Non-Inverting Amplifier + LPF*
* Non-Inverting Amplifier + LPF2*
* Non-Inverting Amplifier + HPF*
* Non-Inverting Amplifier + HPF (variant)
* Non-Inverting Amplifier + Bias
* Non-Inverting Amplifier + Bias of V+/2 (Probe Referenced to V+/2)
* Differential Amplifier
* Summing Inverting Amplifier (2 and 3 inputs)
* Summing Non-Inverting Amplifier
* Transimpedance Amplifier
* Transimpedance Amplifier + Bias

It's the spreadsheet I wish I had when I started to learn about op-amps. There are many more configurations I'd like to add. There are also many mistakes in it, some of which I haven't discovered yet. I am incorporating phase shifts into the spreadsheet (marked with a *).
